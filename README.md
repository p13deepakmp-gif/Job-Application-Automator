Instructions to run the code:
Install Python 3.14
Install Pip (Python package manager) - this mostly gets installed automatically with python.
Install selenium via Terminal command: `pip install selenium`

Edit Iimjobs.py to edit your  your username and password

open terminal and change directory into the folder where your code is and:
1. run via terminal command: `python Iimjobs.py`
2. run via terminal command: `python Naukri.py`

Note: I've added a 60 sec pause in the naukri script to let you login, at this time: please login in the opened browser and go to your profile.

Feel free to keep me updated with the progress.

I wanted to build an app around this but don't have a cloud billing account.
If you're interested, we can automate Shine.com, and foundit.com (formerly monster India) as well.
